patatap-looper
==============

Usage

1. Copy paste the entire source code from patatap-looper.js
2. go to http://www.patatap.com/
3. Open the console and copy-paste the source code and press enter.

If you want to create your own beats just look at the source code, 
you'll get how it works..

it supports beats per minute and beats per loop.

PS. you can play at the same time as the looper is doing it's thang.. :)


Would love create this in the future:

* Sequencer
* Be able to save songs

Please help out if you love music. :)
